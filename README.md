## Implementation of an IR transmission between two computers

Purpose: the main objective of this project is to implement an IR transmission between two computers using a PIC16F877A microcontroller.

The differents components used are:
- The microcontroller: PIC16F877A
- The IR emitting diode: TSUS402
- The MAX232: the dual EIA-232 driver/receiver
- The IR receiver: TSOP31240
- Some NAND Gates for modulation
- An amplifier 2N2222
- Some additional resistors and capacitors
